# zero-to-python
📌 Welcome to my Python learning repository! 

🐍🚀 This repo is a collection of my experiments, exercises, and projects as I teach myself Python. From fundamental concepts like variables, loops, and functions to more advanced topics like algorithms, data structures, and automation, this space serves as my personal coding playground.

What's Inside?
✅ Hands-on practice with Python basics
✅ Small projects and problem-solving exercises
✅ Notes and insights from my learning journey
✅ Experiments with libraries and frameworks

Feel free to explore, learn alongside me, and suggest improvements. Let’s write some Pythonic code! 🧑‍💻🔥

Currently I'm walking through the Book "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz. I highly recommend checking it out.
