# zero-to-python
📌 Welcome to my Python learning repository! 

🐍🚀 This repo is a collection of my experiments, exercises, and projects as I teach myself Python. From fundamental concepts like variables, loops, and functions to more advanced topics like algorithms, data structures, and automation, this space serves as my personal coding playground.

What's Inside?
✅ Hands-on practice with Python basics
✅ Small projects and problem-solving exercises
✅ Notes and insights from my learning journey
✅ Experiments with libraries and frameworks

Feel free to explore, learn alongside me, and suggest improvements. Let’s write some Pythonic code! 🧑‍💻🔥

Currently I'm walking through the Book "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz. I highly recommend checking it out.

There comes a time in every man’s life when he must take up a new craft, and I hear whispers that you wish to embark on the noble quest of learning Python.
Fear not, for I shall guide you as I have guided many others before you.
But first… you must face the choice.

Ah.
So, you’ve chosen to stay the course.
That’s a good sign.
Not all who begin the path are brave enough to continue. But you—you—are still here.
And that, my friend, is where the real adventure begins.
🌱 Where to Begin

As with any great journey, it is best to start small. (Text me if you need anything)

🧙‍♂️ CS50: Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard)
This one’s free! I’ve only glanced through it, but I’ve taken a course from this professor before. He’s concise, easy to follow, and passionate.

And remember: “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.” Spend it learning Python, and you may yet become a coding wizard.

# Variables

    A varaible is the name for a reference that is stored in a computer's memory

    example in Python

        name = "John Doe"
        age = 30 
        height = 1.75
        is_student = false

    each instance above is a different example of defining a value to be stored in a computer. The examples listed above actaully 

# Functions

    Functions can be defined 

# conditionals

    pythonic code

    keyword: match (switch in other languages)
